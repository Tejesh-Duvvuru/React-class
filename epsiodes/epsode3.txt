const heading = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "heading", class: "heading" },
  "Hello"
);  (React)

 <h1 class="heading">I am tejesh</h1>  (html)


 comapre above two react and html, html easy and understand

JSX (JavaScript XML, formally JavaScript Syntax eXtension) is a JavaScript extension that allows creation of Document Object Model (DOM) trees using an XML-like syntax.
 that's why jsx came into picture  
<h1 className="heading">I am tejesh</h1>  (html)
 jsx is not html in js
 jsx is difference then html
 jsx html like syntax
 jsx is not a react

inside jsx we can inject js code by using {}

<h2>{100 + 100} </h2>
